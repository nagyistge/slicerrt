1. Apply the patch to VTK. Build VTK

2. Add this to your code
  "
  #include "vtkLeakFinder.h"

  ...

  vtkLeakFinder* leakFinder = vtkLeakFinder::New();
  leakFinder->SetOutputFileName("D:\\trace.log"); // Optional
  leakFinder->StartTracing();
  "
  [piece of code that leaks]

[Option 1: End tracing manually]
  (probably many objects are not destructed, so the log will be not quite correct)
  "
  leakFinder->EndTracing();
  "
  
[Option 2: Let LeakFinder finalize itself]
  (the leaking objects are collected at the last possible moment before the application closes itself)

  Known problem: In vtkDebugLeaksManager destructor, the counter never reaches 0 if StackWalker::ShowCallstack
    is called (otherwise it does), and so the Finalizing function is not called. There's a workaround in the
    current patch we made, but unfortunately that way many more objects are shown as leaking. The recommended
    usage is to run the application without the VTK patch and LeakFinder and make note of the leaking objects
    (that appear in the popup message when closing). Then apply the patch and use LeakFinder, and filter out the
    objects that don't actually leak.

3. Examine the trace log
  a) Pick a leaking object that has few instances leaking, and is suspected to be a reason for the leaking (for
     example it is constructed from the own code).
  b) Try to match the Register callstacks to the Unregister ones. The Register call that does not have a
     corresponding Unregister call is the cause of the leak.
