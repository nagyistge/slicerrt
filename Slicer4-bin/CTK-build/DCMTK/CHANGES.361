  mode. Also permits giving a timeout for non-blocking mode (default is 1000

  it is expected that most users like to have the server running endlessly.
- Renamed member and functions for DIMSE blocking mode in order to be clearly
  distinguishable from TCP/IP blocking mode.
- Moved message about disabled dcmdata autocorrection to listen() function in
  order to (have the possibility to) suppress it in the child processes.
